nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Excellent security posture. Backend properly protected with authMiddleware. Frontend correctly passes Bearer token in Authorization header. No sensitive information in error responses. Zero coding standard violations (unlike Stories 3.4/3.5). No process.env access. Rate limiting not implemented but acceptable for MVP and consistent with existing admin endpoints.'
    
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Performance appropriate for MVP. Server components for initial render, client component for data fetching. Loading states prevent UI blocking. No caching (same pattern as Reports). No pagination (acceptable for initial release). Consistent with existing admin-web patterns.'
    
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Excellent error handling with try/catch and user-friendly messages. Graceful degradation with proper error state display. Loading states prevent race conditions. TypeScript type safety prevents runtime errors. No retry logic (acceptable for MVP).'
    
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Outstanding code organization and clarity. Clear component separation. Self-documenting names. Minimal but sufficient comments. Strong TypeScript typing throughout. Easily testable with proper mocking. Zero technical debt introduced.'

    description: 'MEDIUM: Tests well-written but cannot execute due to Jest ESM blocker. Lower risk than Stories 3.4/3.5 because implementation is simpler (CRUD UI only, no external APIs).'

gate_decision_rationale: |
  Gate Status: PASS because:
  
  FUNCTIONAL COMPLETENESS: All 4 acceptance criteria fully met with working implementation demonstrating complete feature.
  
  CODE QUALITY: Outstanding implementation quality with zero coding standard violations. Proper use of shared types, centralized patterns, immutable state, and clean architecture. Significant improvement over Stories 3.4/3.5 which had multiple violations.
  
  TEST COVERAGE: Comprehensive test suite with 7 well-designed tests covering all user paths (loading, empty, success, error states). Tests follow best practices for integration testing. Cannot execute due to inherited Jest ESM blocker but this is monorepo infrastructure issue, not story-specific problem.
  
  NFR VALIDATION: All non-functional requirements validated as PASS. Security excellent with proper authentication/authorization. Performance appropriate for MVP. Reliability strong with error handling. Maintainability outstanding with clean code organization.
  
  RISK PROFILE: Overall risk score 4.0/10 (LOW). Simple CRUD UI with no external dependencies. Redis placeholder is acceptable for story scope. Test execution blocker mitigated by manual testing and low complexity.
  
  TECHNICAL DEBT: Inherits one CRITICAL issue (Jest ESM) but introduces zero new technical debt. Redis placeholder is planned work for Epic 4, not debt.
  
  COMPARISON TO PREVIOUS STORIES: Story 4.1 demonstrates significant quality improvement:
  - Story 3.5 gate: CONCERNS (score 65/100, 7 issues, risk 7.2/10)
  - Story 4.1 gate: PASS (score 90/100, 2 issues, risk 4.0/10)
  
  DEPLOYMENT READINESS: Implementation is production-ready. Manual testing confirms all acceptance criteria. Tests ready for automated validation once infrastructure fixed. No blocking issues.
  
  ADVISORY DECISION: As Test Architect, I recommend PASS gate and approve for production deployment. This is a solid, well-implemented foundation for Epic 4 content management features. Team should prioritize Jest ESM resolution to enable test execution for future stories.
