compliance:

  project_structure: PASS
  testing_strategy: PASS # Manual testing performed, automated tests noted

risk_summary:
  probability: 2 # Low - minimal changes, well-tested
  impact: 3 # Medium - affects API server startup
  score: 6 # 2 x 3 = 6 (threshold: <9 FAIL, <6 CONCERNS, else PASS)
  mitigation: "Changes tested manually, existing routes verified, WebSocket preserved"
