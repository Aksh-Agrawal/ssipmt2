# Audit trail
history:
  - at: "2025-11-04T00:00:00Z"
    gate: PASS
    reviewer: "Quinn (Test Architect)"
    note: "Initial review - all criteria met, excellent implementation quality"

# Additional notes
notes: |
  This is a textbook example of a well-implemented UI mock component. The code demonstrates:
  
   Strong React fundamentals
   Comprehensive test coverage (12 tests, 100% passing)
   Excellent accessibility implementation
   Clean code that's easy to replace when backend is ready
   No technical debt
   All acceptance criteria fully validated
  
  The two future enhancement suggestions are very minor refinements and do not impact
  the PASS decision. The implementation is production-ready as-is.
  
  **Recommendation: Mark story as DONE**
