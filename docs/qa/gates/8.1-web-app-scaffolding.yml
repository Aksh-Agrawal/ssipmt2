# Review Notes
review_notes: |
  This is exemplary scaffolding work. The Next.js 15 application is properly
  configured with modern App Router architecture, clean monorepo integration,
  and all quality gates passed. The implementation demonstrates:
  
  - Proper use of shared configurations (@repo/eslint-config, @repo/typescript-config)
  - Clean component structure with TypeScript type safety
  - Well-configured testing infrastructure (Jest + React Testing Library)
  - Appropriate port allocation to avoid conflicts
  - Global CSS with dark mode support
  - Minimal bundle size with optimal static generation
  
  No technical debt identified. No refactoring required. Ready for production use.
  This provides an excellent foundation for subsequent web platform features.
