nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Perfect public API security - only safe data (id, status, updatedAt) exposed via dedicated findByIdPublic() method. No sensitive information leakage."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Optimized single-query database access, lightweight JSON responses, responsive mobile UI with loading states."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Comprehensive error handling for 404, 500, and network failures. Graceful fallbacks with user-friendly messaging."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Clean code architecture following established patterns. Service layer abstraction, proper TypeScript types, excellent test coverage."

security_highlights:
  - "Repository method findByIdPublic() enforces strict column selection"
  - "Public API endpoint correctly excludes authentication middleware"  
  - "No exposure of sensitive fields: description, location, photos, citizen_id"
  - "Generic error messages prevent information disclosure"
  - "Input validation with proper error boundaries"

test_coverage:
  backend_scenarios: 6
  frontend_scenarios: 12
  critical_paths_covered:
    - "Valid tracking ID lookup with status return"
    - "Invalid tracking ID handling (404)"
    - "Database error recovery (500)"
    - "Security validation - safe fields only"
    - "Mobile UI component functionality"
    - "Service integration and error states"

implementation_excellence:
  architecture:
    - "Perfect separation of concerns: UI -> Service -> Repository -> Database"
    - "TypeScript type safety throughout"
    - "React Native best practices with proper state management"
    - "Hono API framework with proper error handling"
  
  user_experience:
    - "Intuitive mobile interface with clear visual feedback"
    - "Color-coded status indicators for quick recognition"
    - "Professional loading states and error messaging" 
    - "Responsive design optimized for mobile devices"
  
  security_design:
    - "Defense in depth: repository, API, and service layer controls"
    - "Public endpoint appropriately designed for citizen access"
    - "No authentication required while maintaining data protection"
    - "Comprehensive input validation and error sanitization"
