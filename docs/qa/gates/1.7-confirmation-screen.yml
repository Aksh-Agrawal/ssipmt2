## Quality Gate Decision

decision: "PASS"
confidence: "HIGH"

rationale: |
  Story 1.7 successfully implements all acceptance criteria with comprehensive test coverage.
  The confirmation screen provides a professional user experience with proper navigation
  integration and Material Design styling. While minor accessibility and security concerns
  exist, they do not block the core functionality and can be addressed in future iterations.

recommendations:
  immediate:
    - "Consider adding accessibility props in next iteration"
    - "Review tracking ID security implications"
  
  future:
    - "Implement comprehensive accessibility audit"
    - "Add error boundary for navigation failures"
    - "Consider internalization support"
