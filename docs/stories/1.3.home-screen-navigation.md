# Story 1.3: Home Screen & Navigation

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** a clear home screen to choose between "Report an Issue" and "Ask a Question,"
**so that** I can easily access the function I need.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A home screen is implemented with two clear, distinct navigation options: "Report an Issue" and "Ask a Question".
2. Tapping "Report an Issue" navigates the user to the report submission screen.
3. Tapping "Ask a Question" navigates the user to the agent/map screen.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Create a new screen component `HomeScreen.tsx` within the `apps/mobile/src/features/home/` directory. (AC: #1)
- [ ] Add two large, accessible `Button` components (from React Native Paper) to the `HomeScreen` with the labels "Report an Issue" and "Ask a Question". (AC: #1)
- [ ] Create placeholder screen components for `ReportSubmissionScreen.tsx` and `AgentChatScreen.tsx` if they do not exist. (AC: #2, #3)
- [ ] Configure the `MainStack.tsx` navigator in `React Navigation` to include routes for the Home, Report Submission, and Agent screens. (AC: #2, #3)
- [ ] Implement the `onPress` handlers for the buttons on the `HomeScreen` to navigate to the correct screens using the `navigation` prop. (AC: #2, #3)

## Dev Notes
This story creates the primary entry point for the user. The design should be simple and unambiguous, guiding the user to one of the two core application features.

- **UI Component Library:** Use `react-native-paper` for UI elements like `Button` to maintain consistency.
- **Routing:** All navigation must be handled by `React Navigation`. Refer to the routing architecture in `docs/architecture/10-frontend-architecture.md`.
- **Component Organization:** Follow the established pattern of placing feature-specific screens in the `/src/features/` directory.
- **State Management:** This screen should be stateless. Navigation state is handled by the `React Navigation` library.

### Testing
- **Unit Test:** A test for `HomeScreen.tsx` should assert that two buttons with the correct labels are rendered.
- **Integration Test:** Using `React Native Testing Library`, write a test to simulate a `press` on each button and verify that the navigation function is called with the correct route name.
