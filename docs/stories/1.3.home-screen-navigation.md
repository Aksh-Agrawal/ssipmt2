# Story 1.3: Home Screen & Navigation

## Status
ready-for-review

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** a clear home screen to choose between "Report an Issue" and "Ask a Question,"
**so that** I can easily access the function I need.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A home screen is implemented with two clear, distinct navigation options: "Report an Issue" and "Ask a Question".
2. Tapping "Report an Issue" navigates the user to the report submission screen.
3. Tapping "Ask a Question" navigates the user to the agent/map screen.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Create a new screen component `HomeScreen.tsx` within the `apps/mobile/src/features/home/` directory. (AC: #1)
- [x] Add two large, accessible `Button` components (from React Native Paper) to the `HomeScreen` with the labels "Report an Issue" and "Ask a Question". (AC: #1)
- [x] Create placeholder screen components for `ReportSubmissionScreen.tsx` and `AgentChatScreen.tsx` if they do not exist. (AC: #2, #3)
- [x] Configure the `MainStack.tsx` navigator in `React Navigation` to include routes for the Home, Report Submission, and Agent screens. (AC: #2, #3)
- [x] Implement the `onPress` handlers for the buttons on the `HomeScreen` to navigate to the correct screens using the `navigation` prop. (AC: #2, #3)

## Dev Notes
This story creates the primary entry point for the user. The design should be simple and unambiguous, guiding the user to one of the two core application features.

- **UI Component Library:** Use `react-native-paper` for UI elements like `Button` to maintain consistency.
- **Routing:** All navigation must be handled by `React Navigation`. Refer to the routing architecture in `docs/architecture/10-frontend-architecture.md`.
- **Component Organization:** Follow the established pattern of placing feature-specific screens in the `/src/features/` directory.
- **State Management:** This screen should be stateless. Navigation state is handled by the `React Navigation` library.

### Testing
- **Unit Test:** A test for `HomeScreen.tsx` should assert that two buttons with the correct labels are rendered.
- **Integration Test:** Using `React Native Testing Library`, write a test to simulate a `press` on each button and verify that the navigation function is called with the correct route name.

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-10-31

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

Excellent implementation of React Native navigation architecture. The HomeScreen component is well-structured with proper TypeScript typing, follows React Native best practices, and implements clean separation of concerns. The navigation setup follows industry standards with proper screen organization and routing configuration.

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: `apps/mobile/src/features/home/HomeScreen.test.tsx`
  - **Change**: Enhanced test coverage to better validate navigation requirements
  - **Why**: Original tests were too basic and didn't validate the key acceptance criteria around navigation behavior
  - **How**: Added specific tests for navigation route validation while maintaining Jest compatibility

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ Excellent adherence to React Native and TypeScript best practices
- Project Structure: ✓ Perfect implementation of feature-based architecture in src/features/
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Comprehensive unit testing with proper mocking strategies
- All ACs Met: ✓ All three acceptance criteria fully satisfied with robust implementation

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] Enhanced test coverage for navigation behavior validation
- [ ] Consider adding accessibility labels for screen readers (accessibilityLabel props)
- [ ] Consider adding loading states for navigation transitions
- [ ] Consider adding haptic feedback for button interactions (future enhancement)

### Security Review

✓ **PASS** - No security concerns identified. Proper TypeScript typing prevents navigation injection issues, and React Navigation handles routing security internally. No sensitive data exposure in navigation parameters.

### Performance Considerations

✓ **PASS** - Efficient implementation with minimal re-renders. React Navigation v6 provides excellent performance characteristics. StyleSheet.create() properly optimizes styles. Navigation structure supports lazy loading of screens.

### Files Modified During Review

- `apps/mobile/src/features/home/HomeScreen.test.tsx` - Enhanced test coverage

### Gate Status

Gate: PASS → docs/qa/gates/1.3-home-screen-navigation.yml

### Recommended Status

✓ **Ready for Done** - Outstanding implementation that exceeds requirements. All acceptance criteria met with robust navigation architecture, comprehensive testing, and adherence to best practices. The foundation for mobile navigation is solidly established.
