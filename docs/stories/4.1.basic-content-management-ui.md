# Story 4.1: Basic Content Management UI

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As an** admin,
**I want** a new section in the admin dashboard for managing the agent's knowledge,
**so that** I have a central place to update its information.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A new link titled "Agent Content" is added to the main navigation of the admin dashboard.
2. Clicking the link navigates to a new page for managing the agent's knowledge base.
3. The new page contains a "Create New Article" button.
4. The new page contains a list or table that displays existing `KnowledgeArticle` items from the Live DB.

## Tasks / Subtasks

### Backend
- [ ] Create a new protected API endpoint `GET /api/v1/admin/knowledge` to fetch all articles from the **Live DB**. (AC: #4)

### Frontend
- [ ] Add a new navigation item for "Agent Content" to the main layout of the `admin-web` app. (AC: #1)
- [ ] Create a new page at `app/dashboard/agent-content/page.tsx`. (AC: #2)
- [ ] Add a "Create New Article" button to this page, which will later link to a creation form. (AC: #3)
- [ ] Implement a data-fetching hook on this page to call the new `GET /api/v1/admin/knowledge` endpoint. (AC: #4)
- [ ] Create a component to display the fetched articles in a table, showing at least the `title` and `tags`. (AC: #4)

## Dev Notes
This story creates the main entry point for admins to perform content management for the AI agent. It mirrors the structure of the report list view from Epic 2.

- **Data Model:** The content being displayed is based on the `KnowledgeArticle` interface from `packages/shared-types`.
- **Database:** The backend API will be querying the **Live DB** (Redis) for this data, not the Complaints DB (PostgreSQL).
- **UI:** A simple table is sufficient for displaying the articles. Each row should have an "Edit" and "Delete" button, which will be implemented in a future story.

### Testing
- **Backend Integration Test:** Write a test for the `GET /api/v1/admin/knowledge` endpoint. Seed the test Redis database with a few `KnowledgeArticle` objects. Assert that the API returns the correct list of articles.
- **Frontend Integration Test:** Write a test for the `Agent Content` page. Mock the API endpoint and verify that the page renders the list of mock articles correctly in the table.
