# Story 2.1: Admin Dashboard UI Shell & Auth

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As an** admin,
**I want** a basic web application with a secure login,
**so that** I have a protected place to view and manage reports.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A new Next.js application is created for the admin dashboard at `apps/admin-web`.
2. A login page is created that allows a user to authenticate using an email and password.
3. Authentication is handled by Supabase Auth.
4. After successful login, the user is redirected to a protected dashboard page.
5. Unauthorized users attempting to access the dashboard page are redirected to the login page.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Bootstrap a new Next.js application within the `apps/admin-web` directory of the monorepo. (AC: #1)
- [x] Create a login screen component (`/src/app/login/page.tsx`) with email and password fields and a login button. (AC: #2)
- [x] Integrate the Supabase Auth client for Next.js (e.g., `@supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs`). (AC: #3)
- [x] Implement the client-side logic to call Supabase's `signInWithPassword` method when the login form is submitted. (AC: #3)
- [x] Create a protected placeholder page for the dashboard (e.g., `/src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`). (AC: #4)
- [x] Implement route protection using Next.js middleware or server-side components to verify the user's auth session. (AC: #5)
- [x] On successful login, redirect the user to the `/dashboard` route. (AC: #4)

## Dev Notes
This story sets up the foundation for the entire web-based admin portal. Security and proper session management are critical.

- **Framework:** Next.js (as per `docs/architecture/6-components.md`).
- **Authentication Provider:** Supabase Auth is the designated provider. Use the official `@supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs` library to handle server-side rendering (SSR) and route protection correctly.
- **Auth Flow:** The authentication flow is detailed in `docs/architecture/11-backend-architecture.md`. The frontend client will interact directly with the Supabase Auth service.
- **UI Components:** While no specific UI library is mandated for the web app, a library like Material-UI (MUI) would be a good choice for consistency with the Material Design principles of the mobile app.

### Testing
- **Unit Test:** Test the `LoginPage` component to ensure it renders correctly and handles user input.
- **Integration Test:** Mock the Supabase client. Test the login form submission to verify it calls the `signInWithPassword` function with the correct credentials. Test the route protection middleware/logic to ensure it correctly redirects unauthenticated users.

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-10-31

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall Assessment: EXCELLENT** - The implementation demonstrates strong technical execution with proper separation of concerns, robust error handling, and comprehensive testing. The authentication system is well-architected and follows modern best practices.

### Refactoring Performed

**Major architectural improvements applied:**

- **File**: `lib/config.ts` (Created)
  - **Change**: Created centralized configuration management for environment variables
  - **Why**: Compliance with coding standard "Centralized Environment Variables" - eliminates direct process.env access
  - **How**: Validates environment variables at startup, provides typed configuration object

- **File**: `lib/supabase/client.ts`
  - **Change**: Refactored to use centralized configuration instead of direct env var access
  - **Why**: Improves maintainability and follows project coding standards
  - **How**: Imports from config module, eliminates duplicate validation logic

- **File**: `lib/supabase/server.ts`
  - **Change**: Refactored to use centralized configuration, enhanced documentation
  - **Why**: Consistency with client implementation and improved code clarity
  - **How**: Added comprehensive JSDoc comments explaining cookie management

- **File**: `middleware.ts`
  - **Change**: Enhanced documentation and error handling comments
  - **Why**: Middleware authentication logic is complex and needs clear explanation
  - **How**: Added comprehensive function-level documentation

- **File**: `app/login/page.tsx`
  - **Change**: Added comprehensive form validation, user-friendly error messages, loading states
  - **Why**: Improves user experience and security through client-side validation
  - **How**: Added validateForm function, enhanced error handling with specific messages, disabled inputs during loading

- **File**: `__tests__/login.test.tsx`
  - **Change**: Expanded test suite to cover validation scenarios and edge cases
  - **Why**: Ensures robust testing of all login functionality including error states
  - **How**: Added tests for empty fields, invalid email format, loading states, user-friendly error messages

### Compliance Check

- **Coding Standards**: ✓ **PASS** - All standards now met after refactoring
  - ✓ Centralized environment variables implemented
  - ✓ Proper TypeScript conventions followed
  - ✓ Component naming follows PascalCase
  - ✓ Function naming follows camelCase
- **Project Structure**: ✓ **PASS** - Files properly organized in Next.js app structure
- **Testing Strategy**: ✓ **PASS** - Comprehensive unit tests with good coverage
- **All ACs Met**: ✓ **PASS** - All acceptance criteria fully implemented

### Security Review

**Strong security implementation:**
- ✅ Environment variables properly validated and centralized
- ✅ Input validation on email format and required fields
- ✅ User-friendly error messages that don't leak sensitive information
- ✅ Proper session management through Supabase SSR
- ✅ Route protection middleware prevents unauthorized access
- ✅ No hardcoded credentials or sensitive data

### Performance Considerations

**Optimized for performance:**
- ✅ Client/server separation properly implemented
- ✅ Minimal bundle size with targeted imports
- ✅ Efficient middleware with early returns
- ✅ Loading states prevent multiple submissions
- ✅ No unnecessary re-renders or API calls

### Files Modified During Review

**Refactoring Files Created/Modified:**

4. **AC4**: ✅ Successful login redirects to dashboard - COVERED by navigation tests
5. **AC5**: ✅ Unauthorized access redirects to login - COVERED by middleware protection

**Test Scenarios Implemented:**
- **Given** user accesses login page **When** they enter valid credentials **Then** they are redirected to dashboard
- **Given** user tries to access dashboard **When** they are not authenticated **Then** they are redirected to login
- **Given** user enters invalid credentials **When** they submit form **Then** user-friendly error is displayed
- **Given** user enters empty/invalid email **When** they submit form **Then** validation error is shown
- **Given** authentication is in progress **When** user tries to interact **Then** form is disabled

### Gate Status

Gate: **PASS** → docs/qa/gates/2.1-admin-dashboard-shell-auth.yml

### Recommended Status

✅ **Ready for Done** - All requirements met with quality improvements applied. Implementation exceeds baseline requirements with robust error handling, comprehensive testing, and proper architecture compliance.
