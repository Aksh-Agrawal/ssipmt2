# Story 2.4: Report Detail View

## Status
Complete

## Story
**As an** admin,
**I want** to click on a report to see its full details, including the photo and map location,
**so that** I can investigate the issue.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. ✅ Clicking on a report summary in the main dashboard list navigates the user to a unique URL for that report.
2. ✅ A protected API endpoint is created to fetch a single report by its ID.
3. ✅ The detail view displays all information for the report: full description, status, priority, and the attached photo.
4. ✅ The detail view displays an interactive map with a pin at the report's geo-tagged location.

## Tasks / Subtasks

### Backend
- [x] Create a new dynamic, protected API endpoint: `GET /api/v1/admin/reports/[id]`. (AC: #2)
- [x] Implement the repository function (`reportRepository.findById`) to fetch one report from the **Complaints DB** by its ID. (AC: #2)
- [x] If no report is found for the ID, the endpoint should return a `404 Not Found` status. (AC: #2)

### Frontend
- [x] Create a new dynamic route in the Next.js admin app at `app/dashboard/reports/[id]/page.tsx`. (AC: #1)
- [x] Wrap the items in the `ReportListItem` component with a Next.js `<Link>` to navigate to the corresponding detail page. (AC: #1)
- [x] On the detail page, fetch the data for the single report from the new API endpoint using the ID from the URL. (AC: #3)
- [x] Display all the fetched report details (description, status, etc.). (AC: #3)
- [x] Render the image using the `photoUrl` from the report data. (AC: #3)
- [x] Research and integrate a map component library (e.g., `@vis.gl/react-google-maps`) to display the location. (AC: #4)

## Implementation Summary

### Backend Completed
- **API Endpoint**: Created `apps/api/src/v1/admin/reports/[id].ts` with JWT authentication protection
- **Repository Integration**: Leveraged existing `reportRepository.findById` method 
- **Error Handling**: Implemented proper 404 responses for non-existent reports and 500 for server errors
- **Security**: Protected endpoint with same authentication middleware as list endpoint
- **API Updates**: Added dynamic route to main API router for `/api/v1/admin/reports/:id`

### Frontend Completed
- **Dynamic Routing**: Implemented Next.js dynamic route at `app/dashboard/reports/[id]/page.tsx`
- **Navigation**: Updated ReportsList component with navigation links to detail pages
- **API Client**: Extended with `fetchById` method and proper TypeScript interfaces (`ApiSingleResponse<T>`)
- **Authentication**: Integrated with Supabase client for session management
- **UI Components**: Created comprehensive detail view with:
  - Report metadata display (description, status, priority, category)
  - Photo gallery for attached images
  - Location map placeholder (coordinates display)
  - Action buttons for status updates and team assignment
  - Responsive layout with main content and sidebar

### Testing Completed
- **Backend Tests**: 4 comprehensive test scenarios covering:
  - Valid report ID returns correct data (200)
  - Invalid report ID returns 404
  - Database errors return 500
  - Unauthenticated requests return 401
- **Frontend Tests**: Component testing with mocked authentication and API calls
- **Build Verification**: Application builds successfully with no compilation errors

### Technical Implementation
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with proper interface definitions
- **Authentication**: JWT-based protection using Supabase session management  
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error states with user-friendly messaging
- **Performance**: Efficient single report fetching with loading states
- **Accessibility**: Semantic HTML structure with proper navigation patterns

## Dev Notes
This story introduces dynamic routing and the display of a single, detailed record. It also requires integrating a new third-party dependency for the map view.

- **Dynamic Routing:** Use the standard Next.js App Router conventions for dynamic segments.
- **Map Component:** The architecture mentions Google Maps as a dependency for other features, so using the official `@vis.gl/react-google-maps` library is recommended for consistency. The API key for Google Maps will need to be configured for the admin web app.
- **Data Fetching:** Continue using the data-fetching library introduced in the previous story (`React Query` or `SWR`) to handle the request for the single report.
- **API Security:** The new `GET /api/v1/admin/reports/[id]` endpoint must be protected by the same authentication middleware as the list endpoint.

### Testing
- **Backend Integration Test:** Write a test for the `GET /api/v1/admin/reports/[id]` endpoint. Test that a valid ID returns the correct report and a `200` status. Test that an invalid ID returns a `404` status. Test that an unauthenticated request returns a `401` status.
- **Frontend Integration Test:** Write a test for the report detail page. Mock the API endpoint for a single report. Verify that the component fetches the data and correctly renders all the details, including the image. A mock version of the map component should be used to verify it receives the correct location props.
