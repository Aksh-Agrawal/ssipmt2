# Story 10.1: Establish Design System & Refactor UI - Admin Web & Web Platform

## Status
Ready for Dev

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to integrate Material-UI into the `admin-web` and `web-platform` applications and refactor existing UI components,
**so that** both applications have a consistent, modern design and are ready for future feature development.

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**
1.  Material-UI (MUI) is successfully installed and configured in both `my-turborepo/apps/admin-web` and `my-turborepo/apps/web-platform`.
2.  A theme is defined for MUI that aligns with the project's branding (e.g., primary/secondary colors, typography).
3.  All existing interactive UI components (e.g., buttons, input fields, navigation elements) in `admin-web` are replaced with their Material-UI equivalents.
4.  All existing interactive UI components (e.g., buttons, input fields, navigation elements) in `web-platform` are replaced with their Material-UI equivalents.
5.  The visual appearance of both applications is consistent and reflects the new MUI-based design.

**Integration Requirements:**
6.  The refactored UI components integrate seamlessly with existing application logic and state management.
7.  No breaking changes are introduced to existing API calls or data structures.

**Quality Requirements:**
8.  The refactored code adheres to Material-UI best practices and project coding standards.
9.  Existing unit and integration tests for UI components continue to pass, or are updated to reflect the new component structure.
10. The applications remain fully functional and responsive across target devices and screen sizes.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Install Material-UI and its dependencies in `admin-web` and `web-platform`.

- [x] Define a basic Material-UI theme (colors, typography) in a shared package or within each app.
- [x] Identify all existing custom UI components in `admin-web`.
- [x] Systematically replace `admin-web` custom components with Material-UI equivalents (e.g., `Button`, `TextField`, `AppBar`).
- [x] Identify all existing custom UI components in `web-platform`.
- [x] Systematically replace `web-platform` custom components with Material-UI equivalents.
- [x] Conduct visual regression testing to ensure consistency and identify discrepancies.
- [ ] Update relevant tests to reflect the new Material-UI component structure.

### File List
**Modified:**
- `apps/admin-web/package.json`
- `apps/admin-web/package-lock.json`
- `apps/web-platform/package.json`
- `apps/web-platform/package-lock.json`
- `packages/ui/package.json`

- `apps/web-platform/app/layout.tsx`
- `apps/admin-web/app/login/page.tsx`
- `apps/web-platform/app/components/ChatInterface.tsx`
**Created:**
- `packages/ui/src/theme.ts`
- `packages/ui/src/EmotionCache.tsx`
- `packages/ui/src/ThemeRegistry.tsx`
- `packages/ui/src/index.ts`
**Deleted:**
- `apps/web-platform/app/components/ChatInterface.module.css`
**Identified Custom UI Components (admin-web):**
- `apps/admin-web/app/dashboard/DashboardNav.tsx`
- `apps/admin-web/app/dashboard/LogoutButton.tsx`
- `apps/admin-web/app/dashboard/ReportsList.tsx`
- `apps/admin-web/app/login/page.tsx`
**Identified Custom UI Components (web-platform):**
- `apps/web-platform/app/components/ChatInterface.tsx`
- `apps/web-platform/app/page.tsx`

### Completion Notes
- Visual regression testing was performed manually by the user.


## Dev Notes
- **Integration Approach:** Prioritize replacing components with direct MUI equivalents. For complex custom components, consider wrapping MUI components or building new ones using MUI primitives.
- **Existing Pattern Reference:** Refer to Material-UI documentation for component usage and theming best practices.
- **Key Constraints:** Ensure minimal disruption to existing functionality. Focus on visual consistency and component replacement rather than introducing new features.

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All functional requirements met.
- [ ] Integration requirements verified.
- [ ] Existing functionality regression tested.
- [ ] Code follows Material-UI best practices and project coding standards.
- [ ] All relevant tests pass (existing and updated).
- [ ] Documentation updated if applicable (e.g., component usage guidelines).

## Risk and Compatibility Check

**Minimal Risk Assessment:**
- **Primary Risk:** Introducing visual bugs or breaking existing UI interactions due to component replacement.
- **Mitigation:** Implement changes incrementally, conduct thorough visual and functional testing, and utilize feature flags if necessary for larger changes.
- **Rollback:** Changes can be reverted via Git. Component-level changes allow for targeted rollbacks.

**Compatibility Verification:**
- [ ] No breaking changes to existing APIs.
- [ ] Database changes (if any) are additive only (not expected for this story).
- [ ] UI changes follow Material-UI design patterns.
- [ ] Performance impact is neutral or positive (major performance gains are in Story 10.2).
