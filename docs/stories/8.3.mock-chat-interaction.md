# Story 8.3: Mock Chat Interaction - Brownfield Addition

## User Story

As a developer,
I want to implement a mock chat interaction where typing a message and clicking "send" displays the message in the chat history,
So that we can test the UI components before backend integration.

## Story Context

**Existing System Integration:**

- Integrates with: The new Next.js web application.
- Technology: Next.js, React
- Follows pattern: New modern UI patterns will be established.
- Touch points: N/A

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. When a user types a message and clicks "Send", the message is added to the chat history display.
2. The input field is cleared after sending a message.
3. The chat history scrolls to show the latest message.

**Integration Requirements:** 
4. The mock interaction is implemented entirely on the client-side.

**Quality Requirements:** 
5. The code for the mock interaction is clean and easy to replace with a real backend integration.

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach:** This will be implemented using React state management within the chat component.
- **Existing Pattern Reference:** N/A
- **Key Constraints:** The mock interaction should not involve any backend calls.

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Functional requirements met
- [ ] Integration requirements verified
- [ ] Existing functionality regression tested
- [ ] Code follows existing patterns and standards
- [ ] Tests pass (existing and new)
- [ ] Documentation updated if applicable

## Risk and Compatibility Check

**Minimal Risk Assessment:**

- **Primary Risk:** N/A
- **Mitigation:** N/A
- **Rollback:** The mock interaction logic can be removed when the real backend is integrated.

**Compatibility Verification:**

- [ ] No breaking changes to existing APIs
- [ ] Database changes (if any) are additive only
- [ ] UI changes follow existing design patterns
- [ ] Performance impact is negligible
