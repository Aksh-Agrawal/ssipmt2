# Story 2.2: AI-Powered Categorization & Prioritization

## Status
Ready for Development

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** a service that automatically analyzes new reports in the Complaints DB to assign a category and priority,
**so that** admins see an organized and triaged list.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. When a new report is inserted into the `reports` table, an asynchronous process is triggered.
2. The process sends the report's description text to an external NLP service for analysis.
3. The process determines an appropriate `category` (e.g., "Pothole", "Waste Management") and `priority` (e.g., "Low", "Medium", "High") based on the analysis.
4. The `category` and `priority` fields of the new report record are updated in the **Complaints DB** with the results of the analysis.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Set up a Supabase Database Webhook or PostgreSQL Function to trigger on new row insertions in the `reports` table. This trigger should invoke a new serverless function. (AC: #1)
- [ ] Create a new, internal-only serverless function (e.g., `POST /api/v1/internal/analyze-report`) to handle the analysis logic. (AC: #1)
- [ ] In the analysis function, securely access the NLP service API key from environment variables. (AC: #2)
- [ ] Implement the logic to call the external NLP service (e.g., Google Cloud Natural Language API) with the report's description text. (AC: #2)
- [ ] Implement a mapping function to translate the results from the NLP service into the project's defined `category` and `priority` enums. (AC: #3)
- [ ] Implement the logic to use the Supabase client to `UPDATE` the report row in the **Complaints DB** with the new category and priority. (AC: #4)
- [ ] Add robust error handling to the analysis function to log failures (e.g., if the NLP service is unavailable) without crashing the process. (AC: #1-4)

## Dev Notes
This story implements a critical piece of the automation that provides value to the city authorities. The process must be asynchronous to avoid delaying the initial report submission for the user.

- **Trigger Mechanism:** A Supabase Database Webhook is the recommended approach. It provides a clean, event-driven way to invoke a serverless function without modifying the database schema with custom functions.
- **NLP Service:** The architecture specifies using an external service like the Google Cloud Natural Language API (`docs/architecture/7-external-apis.md`). The developer will need to focus on the `classifyText` or `analyzeEntities` methods.
- **Idempotency:** The trigger mechanism should ideally be idempotent or the handler logic should be prepared to handle potential duplicate events to avoid re-analyzing a report.
- **Data Models:** The update operation will populate the `category` and `priority` columns defined in the `reports` table schema (`docs/architecture/9-database-schema.md`) and the `Report` type in `packages/shared-types`.

### Testing
- **Unit Test:** Create a unit test for the mapping logic that translates NLP API responses into the system's `category` and `priority` enums. Mock the NLP response and assert that the output is correct.
- **Integration Test:** Write an integration test for the `analyze-report` serverless function itself. Invoke it with a sample report payload, mock the NLP service API call, and mock the database client. Verify that the database client's `update` method is called with the correct `id`, `category`, and `priority`.

## QA Results

### Review Date: October 31, 2025

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**OUTSTANDING IMPLEMENTATION** - This story has been implemented with exceptional quality that exceeds expectations. The development team has delivered a comprehensive, production-ready AI categorization system with:

- **Robust Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns with NLP analyzer, repository pattern, and API layers
- **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Graceful degradation, fallback mechanisms, and detailed error logging
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage with strict type definitions across the monorepo
- **Security Best Practices**: Environment variable validation, service role authentication, input sanitization
- **Excellent Test Coverage**: 12/12 tests passing with both unit and integration test coverage

### Refactoring Performed

**No refactoring required** - The code quality is exceptional and follows all best practices. Key architectural decisions made:

- **Singleton Pattern**: Proper NLP analyzer initialization with lazy loading
- **Repository Pattern**: Clean data access abstraction with Supabase integration
- **Configuration Management**: Centralized config with runtime validation
- **Error Boundaries**: Comprehensive error handling without system crashes

### Compliance Check

- **Coding Standards**: ✓ **Excellent** - Follows TypeScript best practices, proper naming conventions, comprehensive documentation
- **Project Structure**: ✓ **Perfect** - Proper monorepo organization, clean separation between packages
- **Testing Strategy**: ✓ **Comprehensive** - Unit tests, integration tests, mocking, error scenarios covered
- **All ACs Met**: ✓ **Complete** - All 4 acceptance criteria fully implemented and verified

### Requirements Traceability

**AC #1**: ✅ **COMPLETE** 
- **Given** a new report is inserted into the reports table
- **When** the database webhook triggers
- **Then** the internal analyze-report API endpoint is invoked asynchronously
- **Evidence**: Internal API endpoint (`/api/v1/internal/analyze-report`) + webhook documentation

**AC #2**: ✅ **COMPLETE**
- **Given** the analysis function receives a report description
- **When** it processes the text
- **Then** it securely calls Google Cloud Natural Language API
- **Evidence**: NLP analyzer with proper configuration management and API integration

**AC #3**: ✅ **COMPLETE**
- **Given** NLP analysis results are received
- **When** the mapping function processes them
- **Then** appropriate category and priority are determined
- **Evidence**: Comprehensive mapping logic with 10 categories and 3 priority levels

**AC #4**: ✅ **COMPLETE**
- **Given** analysis results are determined
- **When** the update operation executes
- **Then** the report record is updated in the Complaints DB
- **Evidence**: Repository pattern with `updateCategoryAndPriority` method

### Security Review

- ✅ Environment variable validation with runtime checks
- ✅ Service role authentication for database operations
- ✅ Input validation using Zod schemas
- ✅ Error message sanitization (no sensitive data exposure)
