### **Story Title: Display Report Statistics - Brownfield Addition**

**User Story:**

As an admin,
I want to see key statistics about the reports (e.g., total reports, open reports, closed reports),
So that I can get a quick overview of the system's health.

**Story Context:**

*   **Existing System Integration:**
    *   Integrates with: Admin Dashboard and `reports` database table.
    *   Technology: Next.js (frontend), Node.js/Express (backend), PostgreSQL (database).
    *   Follows pattern: Existing admin dashboard UI patterns.
    *   Touch points: A new API endpoint to fetch report statistics.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

*   **Functional Requirements:**
    1.  The admin dashboard shall display the total number of reports.
    2.  The admin dashboard shall display the total number of "open" reports.
    3.  The admin dashboard shall display the total number of "closed" reports.
*   **Integration Requirements:**
    4.  Existing report management functionality continues to work unchanged.
    5.  The new statistics display follows the existing dashboard's visual design and patterns.
    6.  Integration with the new API endpoint maintains current system behavior and performance.
*   **Quality Requirements:**
    7.  The new API endpoint and frontend component are covered by appropriate tests.
    8.  Documentation for the new API endpoint is created.
    9.  No regression in existing dashboard functionality is verified.

**Technical Notes:**

*   **Integration Approach:** A new GET endpoint (e.g., `/api/reports/statistics`) will be created to provide the statistical data. The Next.js dashboard will fetch data from this endpoint.
*   **Existing Pattern Reference:** Follow the established styling and component structure of the existing admin dashboard.
*   **Key Constraints:** The database queries for these statistics must be optimized to ensure they do not degrade the performance of the primary application.

**Risk and Compatibility Check:**

*   **Minimal Risk Assessment:**
    *   **Primary Risk:** Performance degradation of the database due to new queries.
    *   **Mitigation:** Optimize queries and cache the results if necessary.
    *   **Rollback:** The new dashboard section can be hidden via a feature flag if issues arise.
*   **Compatibility Verification:**
    *   [x] No breaking changes to existing APIs.
    *   [x] Database changes are additive only (in this case, no changes needed).
    *   [x] UI changes follow existing design patterns.
    *   [x] Performance impact is negligible.

**Definition of Done:**

*   [ ] Functional requirements met.
*   [ ] Integration requirements verified.
*   [ ] Existing functionality regression tested.
*   [ ] Code follows existing patterns and standards.
*   [ ] Tests pass (existing and new).
*   [ ] Documentation updated.
