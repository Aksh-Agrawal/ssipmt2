# Story 1.7: Confirmation Screen

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** citizen,
**I want** a confirmation screen with a tracking ID,
**so that** I have confidence my report was received and can track it later.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. After a report is successfully submitted, the user is navigated to a new confirmation screen.
2. The confirmation screen prominently displays the unique tracking ID returned from the backend.
3. The screen includes a clear success message (e.g., "Report Submitted!").
4. The screen has a "Done" or "Return Home" button that navigates the user back to the application's home screen.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Create a new screen component `ConfirmationScreen.tsx`. (AC: #1)
- [ ] Add the `ConfirmationScreen` to the `MainStack.tsx` navigator. (AC: #1)
- [ ] On the `ConfirmationScreen`, add UI elements to display a success message and the tracking ID. (AC: #2, #3)
- [ ] Add a "Done" button to the `ConfirmationScreen` that navigates the user back to the `HomeScreen`. (AC: #4)
- [ ] In `ReportSubmissionScreen.tsx`, after the `reportService.submitReport` call succeeds, implement the navigation to the `ConfirmationScreen`, passing the returned `trackingId` as a route parameter. (AC: #1, #2)
- [ ] The `ConfirmationScreen` component must be able to receive and display the `trackingId` from the route parameters. (AC: #2)

## Dev Notes
This story completes the core user flow for issue reporting. The primary goal of this screen is to provide immediate, positive feedback and a crucial piece of information (the tracking ID) to the user.

- **UI/UX:** The screen should be clean and simple. The tracking ID should be easily readable and copyable.
- **Navigation:** The `trackingId` should be passed from the `ReportSubmissionScreen` to the `ConfirmationScreen` via `React Navigation` route params. The "Done" button should reset the reporting navigation stack, returning the user to the top-level home screen.
- **Data Flow:** `ReportSubmissionScreen` -> (calls service) -> gets `trackingId` -> `navigation.navigate('Confirmation', { trackingId: '...' })` -> `ConfirmationScreen` reads `trackingId` from `route.params`.

### Testing
- **Unit Test:** Write a test for the `ConfirmationScreen` component. Provide a mock `trackingId` through route params and assert that it is correctly rendered in a `Text` component.
- **Integration Test:** In the `ReportSubmissionScreen` integration test, after mocking a successful API call, assert that `navigation.navigate` is called with the route name `Confirmation` and the expected `trackingId` parameter.
