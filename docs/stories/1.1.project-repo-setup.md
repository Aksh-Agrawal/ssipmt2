# Story 1.1: Project & Repo Setup

## Status

approved

## Story

**As a** developer,
**I want** to initialize the monorepo with separate packages for the mobile app and backend services,
**so that** we have a clean, organized structure.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. A monorepo is created in Git with placeholder packages for the mobile app, reporting service, agent service, and admin service.
2. Basic linting and formatting configurations are in place.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Initialize a new Turborepo monorepo.
- [ ] Create application stubs within the `apps` directory for `mobile`, `admin-web`, and `api`. (AC: #1)
- [ ] Create shared package stubs within the `packages` directory for `shared-types`, `ui`, `config`, and `hooks`. (AC: #1)
- [ ] Create backend service packages within `packages/services` for `reporting` and `agent`. (AC: #1)
- [ ] Add base ESLint and Prettier configurations to the `packages/config` directory and apply them to the workspace. (AC: #2)
- [ ] Configure the root `turbo.json` to define build, test, and lint pipelines. (AC: #2)

## Dev Notes

This foundational story establishes the monorepo structure as defined in the architecture document. All subsequent development will build upon this structure.

- **Monorepo Tool:** Turborepo
- **Package Manager:** uv
- **Repository Structure:**
  - `apps/mobile`: React Native mobile application.
  - `apps/admin-web`: Next.js admin dashboard.
  - `apps/api`: Hono backend API on Vercel.
  - `packages/shared-types`: Shared TypeScript types (e.g., Report, User).
  - `packages/ui`: Shared React components.
  - `packages/config`: Shared configurations (ESLint, TypeScript).
  - `packages/services/*`: Backend business logic for microservices.

### Testing

- **Testing Frameworks:** Jest will be used for all unit and integration testing. React Native Testing Library (RNTL) for mobile components and Supertest for backend API endpoints.
- **Test Location:** Tests must be co-located with the source code they are testing (e.g., `component.tsx` and `component.test.tsx` in the same folder).
- **Standards:** Follow the patterns outlined in the architecture document (Section 16.3).
