# Story 2.6: Citizen Status Check

## Status
Complete

## Story
**As a** citizen,
**I want** to use my tracking ID to see the current status of my report,
**so that** I know if it's being addressed.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A new public-facing API endpoint is created to fetch the status of a report by its ID.
2. The endpoint only returns non-sensitive data (e.g., `id`, `status`, `updatedAt`).
3. The mobile app has a feature (e.g., a new screen or modal) allowing a user to enter a tracking ID.
4. The app calls the public endpoint with the ID and displays the returned status to the user.

## Tasks / Subtasks

### Backend
- [x] Create a new **public** API endpoint: `GET /api/v1/reports/[id]`. (AC: #1)
- [x] Implement a repository function to fetch a report by its ID, but only select the public-safe columns (`id`, `status`, `updated_at`). (AC: #2)
- [x] Ensure this endpoint has NO authentication middleware applied. (AC: #1)
- [x] The endpoint should return a `404 Not Found` if the ID does not exist. (AC: #4)

### Frontend (Mobile App)
- [x] Add a "Check Status" button or link to the `HomeScreen`. (AC: #3)
- [x] Create a new screen or modal (`StatusCheckScreen.tsx`) with a text input for the tracking ID and a "Check" button. (AC: #3)
- [x] Add a new function to the `reportService` to call the public `GET /api/v1/reports/[id]` endpoint. (AC: #4)
- [x] When the user submits an ID, call the service and display the returned status and last updated time. (AC: #4)
- [x] Handle and display errors, such as when a tracking ID is not found. (AC: #4)

## Dev Notes
This story closes the feedback loop for the citizen. The most critical aspect is ensuring the public API endpoint does not expose any private or sensitive information.

- **Security & Privacy:** The public `GET /api/v1/reports/[id]` endpoint is distinct from the admin-only `GET /api/v1/admin/reports/[id]` endpoint. It is imperative that the public endpoint **only** returns fields that are safe for public consumption. Returning location data, photos, or full descriptions would be a security failure.
- **Data to Expose:** The only fields returned by this endpoint should be `id`, `status`, and `updatedAt`.
- **UI/UX:** The user interface for checking a status should be simple and easy to find from the home screen. The result should be presented clearly and unambiguously.

### Testing
- **Backend Integration Test:** Write a test specifically for the public `GET /api/v1/reports/[id]` endpoint. Create a report, then call the endpoint. Assert that the response status is `200` and that the body **only** contains the allowed public fields (`id`, `status`, `updatedAt`) and nothing else.
- **Frontend Integration Test:** Write a test for the `StatusCheckScreen`. Mock the public API. Simulate a user entering an ID and pressing the button. Verify that the correct service function is called and that the returned status is displayed correctly. Also test the flow for a `404` error from the API.

### Security Review

**STATUS: SECURE** ✅ **CRITICAL SECURITY EXCELLENCE**

**Public API Security Analysis:**
- **Data Exposure**: ✅ Perfect implementation - only `id`, `status`, `updatedAt` exposed
- **Repository Layer**: ✅ Dedicated `findByIdPublic()` method with strict column selection  
- **SQL Injection**: ✅ Protected via Supabase parameterized queries
- **Information Leakage**: ✅ Generic error messages prevent data disclosure
- **Authentication**: ✅ Correctly implemented as public endpoint (no auth required)
- **Authorization**: ✅ N/A for public endpoint - data exposure already minimized
- **Input Validation**: ✅ Proper ID parameter handling with error boundaries

**Critical Security Validation:**
- ✅ **NO** description, location, photos, or citizen_id exposed to public
- ✅ **NO** admin-specific data or system information leaked
- ✅ **NO** database structure or internal IDs revealed
- ✅ Error handling provides user-friendly messages without technical details

### Performance Considerations

**STATUS: OPTIMIZED** ✅

- **Database Efficiency**: Single-query repository method with minimal column selection
- **API Response**: Lightweight JSON payload (~100 bytes typical)
- **Mobile UX**: Loading states, optimistic updates, and responsive design
- **Error Recovery**: Fast fallback with clear user guidance
- **Memory Impact**: Minimal - reuses existing service patterns

### Requirements Traceability
