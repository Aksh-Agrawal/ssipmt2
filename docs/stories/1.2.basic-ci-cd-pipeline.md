# Story 1.2: Basic CI/CD Pipeline

## Status

Draft

## Story

**As a** developer,
**I want** a basic CI/CD pipeline that runs on every commit to ensure code quality,
**so that** we can maintain a consistent and verifiable codebase.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. The pipeline is triggered on pushes and pull requests to the `main` and `develop` branches.
2. The pipeline successfully installs all monorepo dependencies.
3. The pipeline executes the monorepo-wide linting command and passes if there are no linting errors.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Create the directory structure `.github/workflows`. (AC: #1)
- [ ] Create a new GitHub Actions workflow file (e.g., `ci.yaml`). (AC: #1)
- [ ] Configure the workflow to trigger on `push` and `pull_request` events for the `main` and `develop` branches. (AC: #1)
- [ ] Add a job to the workflow that checks out the code, sets up `uv`, and sets up the correct Node.js version (v18+). (AC: #2)
- [ ] Add a step to the job that runs `uv install` to install all dependencies. (AC: #2)
- [ ] Add a final step to the job that runs `uv turbo lint` to check code quality across the monorepo. (AC: #3)

## Dev Notes

This story implements the initial CI/CD pipeline as specified in the architecture document. The goal is to establish an automated check for code quality, not a full deployment pipeline at this stage.

- **CI/CD Platform:** GitHub Actions.
- **Trigger Events:** `push`, `pull_request`.
- **Target Branches:** `main`, `develop`.
- **Key Commands:** The pipeline must execute `uv install` and `uv turbo lint`.
- **Reference:** The implementation should follow the example provided in `docs/architecture/14-deployment-architecture.md`.

### Testing

- The success of this story is verified by the successful run of the GitHub Actions pipeline itself. A passing pipeline run, triggered by a commit, indicates that all acceptance criteria have been met.
