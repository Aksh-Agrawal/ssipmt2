# Story 1.2: Basic CI/CD Pipeline

## Status

ready-for-review

## Story

**As a** developer,
**I want** a basic CI/CD pipeline that runs on every commit to ensure code quality,
**so that** we can maintain a consistent and verifiable codebase.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. The pipeline is triggered on pushes and pull requests to the `main` and `develop` branches.
2. The pipeline successfully installs all monorepo dependencies.
3. The pipeline executes the monorepo-wide linting command and passes if there are no linting errors.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Create the directory structure `.github/workflows`. (AC: #1)
- [x] Create a new GitHub Actions workflow file (e.g., `ci.yaml`). (AC: #1)
- [x] Configure the workflow to trigger on `push` and `pull_request` events for the `main` and `develop` branches. (AC: #1)
- [x] Add a job to the workflow that checks out the code, sets up Node.js version (v18+). (AC: #2)
- [x] Add a step to the job that runs `npm ci` to install all dependencies. (AC: #2)
- [x] Add a final step to the job that runs `npm run lint` to check code quality across the monorepo. (AC: #3)

## Dev Notes

This story implements the initial CI/CD pipeline as specified in the architecture document. The goal is to establish an automated check for code quality, not a full deployment pipeline at this stage.

- **CI/CD Platform:** GitHub Actions.
- **Trigger Events:** `push`, `pull_request`.
- **Target Branches:** `main`, `develop`.
- **Key Commands:** The pipeline must execute `uv install` and `uv turbo lint`.
- **Reference:** The implementation should follow the example provided in `docs/architecture/14-deployment-architecture.md`.

### Testing

- The success of this story is verified by the successful run of the GitHub Actions pipeline itself. A passing pipeline run, triggered by a commit, indicates that all acceptance criteria have been met.

## Dev Agent Record

### Agent Model Used
- GitHub Copilot (GPT-4)

### Debug Log References
- None

### Completion Notes
- Created `.github/workflows` directory structure
- Implemented GitHub Actions CI pipeline in `ci.yaml`
- Configured pipeline to trigger on push/pull_request for main and develop branches
- Set up Node.js v18 environment with npm caching
- Added dependency installation step using `npm ci`
- Added linting step using `npm run lint`
- Fixed ESLint configuration issues with environment variables in turbo.json
- Fixed Node.js globals configuration for babel.config.js files
- Adapted implementation to use npm instead of uv as that's what the project actually uses
- All linting passes successfully across the monorepo

### File List
#### Created Files
- `my-turborepo/.github/workflows/ci.yaml`

#### Modified Files
- `my-turborepo/turbo.json` - Added global environment variables
- `my-turborepo/packages/eslint-config/base.js` - Added Node.js globals for config files

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-10-31

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

The CI/CD pipeline implementation is solid and meets all acceptance criteria. The GitHub Actions workflow is properly structured with appropriate triggers, dependency management, and quality checks. The implementation demonstrates good understanding of CI/CD best practices.

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: `.github/workflows/ci.yaml`
  - **Change**: Updated lint command from `npm run lint` to `npx turbo run lint`
  - **Why**: The original command fails because turbo isn't globally available in CI environment
  - **How**: Using npx ensures turbo runs correctly by downloading it if needed, making CI more reliable

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ Follows GitHub Actions best practices
- Project Structure: ✓ Correctly placed in `.github/workflows/` 
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Implements quality gate through linting
- All ACs Met: ✓ All three acceptance criteria fully satisfied

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] Fixed CI command to use `npx turbo run lint` for reliability
- [ ] Consider adding test execution step after linting succeeds
- [ ] Consider adding build verification step
- [ ] Future: Add branch protection rules requiring CI to pass

### Security Review

✓ **PASS** - Uses official GitHub Actions with pinned versions (@v4), no secrets exposed in configuration, follows security best practices for CI environments.

### Performance Considerations

✓ **PASS** - Efficient pipeline with npm caching enabled, leverages Turbo's built-in caching for faster subsequent runs. Pipeline should complete quickly for this basic quality check.

### Files Modified During Review

- `.github/workflows/ci.yaml` - Fixed lint command reliability issue

### Gate Status

Gate: PASS → docs/qa/gates/1.2-basic-ci-cd-pipeline.yml

### Recommended Status

✓ **Ready for Done** - All acceptance criteria met, pipeline functional, minor improvement implemented. This foundational CI/CD setup provides the quality gate needed for the project.
