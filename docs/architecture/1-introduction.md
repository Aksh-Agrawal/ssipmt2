# 1. Introduction

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for the AI-Powered Civic Voice Assistant, including backend systems, frontend implementation, and their integration. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack.

This unified approach combines what would traditionally be separate backend and frontend architecture documents, streamlining the development process for modern fullstack applications where these concerns are increasingly intertwined.

## 1.1. Starter Template or Existing Project

N/A - This is a greenfield project.

While no specific starter template was mandated in the PRD, the architecture will be designed with modern full-stack frameworks in mind. Based on the requirements (monorepo, React-based frontend, Node.js backend), a starter like the **T3 Stack (create-t3-turbo)** or a custom **Turborepo** setup would be highly appropriate. For this document, we will proceed with designing the architecture from first principles, but the final implementation could be accelerated by using one of these templates.
