# 19. Monitoring and Observability

A robust monitoring strategy is essential for understanding the health, performance, and usage of our application. This section outlines the tools and key metrics we will track to ensure operational excellence.

## 19.1. Monitoring Stack

- **Frontend Monitoring:**
  - **Vercel Analytics:** For web vitals, page views, and general frontend performance metrics for the `admin-web` app.
  - **Sentry:** For real-time error tracking and performance monitoring across both the `mobile` and `admin-web` applications.
- **Backend Monitoring:**
  - **Vercel Analytics:** For serverless function invocations, cold starts, and execution durations of the `api` endpoints.
  - **Supabase Dashboard:** For detailed PostgreSQL database metrics (CPU, memory, connections, query performance) and Redis metrics.
- **Error Tracking:**
  - **Sentry:** A centralized platform for capturing, aggregating, and alerting on all application errors (frontend and backend).
- **Performance Monitoring:**
  - **Vercel Analytics & Sentry:** Will provide initial performance insights. For deeper analysis, custom metrics might be integrated into a dashboard.

## 19.2. Key Metrics

**Frontend Metrics:**
- **Core Web Vitals:** Largest Contentful Paint (LCP), First Input Delay (FID), Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) for `admin-web`.
- **JavaScript Errors:** Number and rate of unhandled exceptions and console errors (tracked by Sentry).
- **API Response Times:** Latency of API calls as experienced by the client.
- **User Interactions:** Key user flows completion rates, screen views, and button clicks.

**Backend Metrics:**
- **Request Rate:** Number of API requests per second (RPS) for each endpoint.
- **Error Rate:** Percentage of API requests resulting in 5xx errors.
- **Response Time:** Average, p95, and p99 latency for each API endpoint.
- **Cold Starts:** Frequency and duration of serverless function cold starts.
- **Database Query Performance:** Slow query logs, connection pool usage, and overall database resource utilization.
- **External API Call Success/Failure Rates:** Monitoring the reliability of calls to the Google Maps and NLP APIs.
