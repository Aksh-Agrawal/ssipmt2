# 15. Security and Performance

This section outlines the strategies for ensuring the application is secure, performant, and reliable. These are not afterthoughts but core architectural considerations.

## 15.1. Security Requirements

**Frontend Security:**
- **CSP Headers:** A strict Content Security Policy (CSP) will be configured in `vercel.json` to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) and data injection attacks.
- **XSS Prevention:** React and React Native inherently mitigate XSS by escaping content rendered in JSX. We will rely on this and avoid dangerous practices like `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`.
- **Secure Storage:** On the mobile app, sensitive items like refresh tokens will be stored in the device's secure enclave using `react-native-keychain`. For the web admin app, Supabase's auth client will use `httpOnly` cookies.

**Backend Security:**
- **Input Validation:** All incoming API request bodies and parameters will be strictly validated using `Zod` against our shared TypeScript types. Any invalid request will be rejected with a 400 error.
- **Rate Limiting:** Vercel's edge network will be configured to enforce rate limiting on all API endpoints to prevent abuse and denial-of-service attacks.
- **CORS Policy:** The Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policy will be configured on Vercel to only allow requests from our specific application domains.

**Authentication Security:**
- **Token Storage:** JWTs will be managed by the Supabase client libraries, which follow best practices for secure storage (as described above).
- **Session Management:** We will use stateless JWTs with short-lived access tokens and long-lived refresh tokens, which is a secure and scalable pattern handled automatically by Supabase.
- **Password Policy:** We will enforce strong password policies (minimum length, complexity) within the Supabase Auth settings.

## 15.2. Performance Optimization

**Frontend Performance:**
- **Bundle Size Target:** We will use tools like `react-native-bundle-visualizer` and Next.js's build analyzer to monitor and minimize bundle sizes.
- **Loading Strategy:** We will aggressively use code splitting and lazy loading (`React.lazy`) for screens and components. For long lists, we will use virtualized lists (`FlatList`, `react-window`) to render only visible items.
- **Caching Strategy:** We will use a client-side data-caching library like `React Query` (TanStack Query) to cache API responses, reducing redundant network requests and providing a faster, more optimistic UI.

**Backend Performance:**
- **Response Time Target:** Our goal is a p95 response time of < 200ms for all common API endpoints.
- **Database Optimization:** The indexes defined in the PostgreSQL schema are the primary optimization. We will also analyze query performance using `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` for any slow endpoints.
- **Caching Strategy:** The Redis "Live DB" is our primary caching layer for hot data like traffic information. We can also implement a cache-aside strategy for read-heavy endpoints in the `reporting-service` if needed.
