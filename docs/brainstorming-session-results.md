## Problem & Solution Analysis

This session focused on identifying potential failures and designing solutions to mitigate them.

### 1. Data & Information Reliability

*   **Problem Identified:** The system could fail if it's filled with fake user reports (**Bad Data**) or provides wrong advice due to outdated APIs (**Unreliable Information**).
*   **Solution Designed:**
    *   Implement a verification system requiring **geo-tagged photo proof** for physical complaints (e.g., potholes, garbage).
    *   Strictly use **vetted, trustworthy, and real-time APIs** (e.g., Google Maps) for dynamic data like traffic.

### 2. User Experience & Accessibility

*   **Problem Identified:** The assistant could fail if it's too **complex** for non-tech-savvy users or if it doesn't support local languages and dialects (**Language Barriers**).
*   **Solution Designed:**
    *   Design an extremely **simple, intuitive interface**, likely with a single "Tap and Speak" button and large, clear visuals. The goal is a system so simple that **no tutorial is needed**.
    *   Integrate a powerful multilingual engine (like 'svaram ai' was suggested) to ensure support for **local languages (e.g., Chhattisgarhi)**.
    *   The AI should guide users with helpful suggestions when it doesn't understand a request.

### 3. Authority Workflow & Accountability

*   **Problem Identified:** The project could fail if officials are overwhelmed by a flood of **unprioritized complaints** or if citizens feel their reports are ignored (**Lack of Accountability**).
*   **Solution Designed:**
    *   The AI will **automatically categorize and prioritize** all incoming reports based on urgency (e.g., 1. Emergencies, 2. Major Disruptions, 3. Minor Issues).
    *   The system will provide an **immediate confirmation and tracking reference** to the citizen upon submitting a complaint, ensuring transparency and building trust.

### 4. Project Sustainability

*   **Problem Identified:** The project could become too expensive to maintain due to **costly software licenses**.
*   **Solution Designed:**
    *   Prioritize the use of **high-quality, open-source libraries and technology stacks** where possible to ensure long-term sustainability.

## Action Planning: Key Features for Prototype

Based on our session, the following features are critical for a successful working prototype:

1.  **Verified Reporting:** A mechanism for users to submit geo-tagged photos for certain complaint types.
2.  **Prioritized Dashboard:** The admin view must display complaints sorted by urgency level, not just chronologically.
3.  **Confirmation Loop:** Users must receive an automated confirmation (and ideally a tracking ID) after submitting a report.
4.  **Simplified UI:** The user-facing interface should be minimalist and voice-forward.
5.  **Multilingual Support:** At least one local language besides Hindi/English should be included in the prototype's scope.
